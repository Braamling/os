\section{Introduction}
This report is for the course Operating Systems(UvA), we will discuss FAT12 filesystems extracting FAT12 partitions and finding and solving data corruptions. For the assignment we got a skeletoon code, to which we added extraction funtionalities and improved data corruption detection within the code. Solving the data corruptions was not part of the assignment, we will only be discussing theoratical solutions.
\section{Overview of the FAT12 filesystem}
FAT12 was introduced in august 1980, and was designed to be a floppydisk filesystem, but was later used as a hard disk filesystem. The newest version of the FAT filesystem, FAT32 is widely used on USB drives.
\section{FAT12 file extraction}
The extraction begins with going through the FAT12 table and buffering the found files, then the buffers are written to correct folders. When a new folder is found in this process it is created. Corupted files will not be handeled and a message is returned with the type of corruption and the name of the corrupted file or the locations of the clusters.
\section{Data corruption in FAT12}
\subsection{Inconsistency in the two file allocation tables}
Every FAT filesystem has two file allocation tables that should be identical, when this is not the case one of the two inconsistent and th
ere is a high risk of corrupt data.
\subsection{Empty assigned clusters}
When there are more clusters assigned to a file then needed, whilst retrieving a file,this indicates missing file data. 
\subsection{More clusters used then assigned}
When the length in the DIRENTRY is exceeded but there are still more references to other clusters, this is an indication of corrupted administration.
\subsection{Double cluster references}
When there are two DIRENTRIES refering to one set of clusters this indicates a administration corruption. Multiple references to a set of clusters is not supported.
\subsection{Looping references}
When a cluster references to a previously read cluster, this would create a infinite loop, to avoid getting stuck in the loop, the program stops when the the number of clusters to go through is reached.
\subsection{The root and parent folders}
Every folder in a fat file system has a . and a .. folder reference. The . goes to the root of the file system and de .. goes to the parent of the current folder. These two references should not be present in the root folder.
\subsection{Filenames}
Filenames should not contain unsupported or illegal characters and should have a positive length.
\subsection{Folder sizes}
Folders have a size of zero, different sizes indicate corruption.
\section{Solutions to corruptions}
\subsection{Inconsistency in the two file allocation tables}
Search for corruptions in both the file allocation tables and keep the one that has none.
\subsection{Empty assigned clusters}
The clusters must be recovered with the help of data recovery tools, chances of full data recovery are very small.
\subsection{More clusters used then assigned}
Ignore the length in the DIRENTRY and try to find the end of the clusters.
\subsection{Double cluster references}
In this case there are two possibilities: One file it's direntry is overridden by another and therefor cannot be located on the disk. The other one is that there are just two direntries for one file. The first case cannot be solved unless there is information available about the file and the clusters are manually searched. The second case not solvable. The file exists in two places. The user should deside which one to keep, no data is lost.
\subsection{Looping references}
Build in safeguards to prevent systems crashes caused by infinite loops when reading or extracting the files. The only possible solution is manually searching for the remaining clusters.
\subsection{The root and parent folders}
When . or .. folders are found in the root folders these should be deleted. When they are not found in sub folders they should be added. Parent folders can be found by searching through the rest of the system.
\subsection{Filenames}
Corrupted filenames should be fixed by using placeholders or querying the user for a new filename.
\subsection{Folder sizes}
When a folder is found with another size of then zero the size should be simply changed to zero and any linked clusters should be deleted.
\section{Results}

\section{Conclusion}
Fat12 file systems are far from perfect. But they give great perspective in how file systems work. The corruptions found can be caused by alot of things and could occure on other file systems as well. Solving these corruptions can be a pain in the ass, preventing data loss by regularly making backups is alot easier then recovering lost data.
